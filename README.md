# NeurIPS-2025-E2LM-Competition-Early-Training-Evaluation-of-Language-Models-our-solution-
We propose MMLU-Curriculum for the E2LM challenge, a curriculum-based benchmark that ranks MMLU tasks by difficulty using small model performance, assigns easier tasks early and harder ones later, and converts MCQs to cloze-style generation for smoother, more discriminative evaluation.
